# Calculator
I made this simple calculator application with basic algebraic function using Kotlin in Android studio.
This project is very friendly for beginners who wants to learn android development using Kotlin.
I made this project using a youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hSHgungOKI
This project performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
